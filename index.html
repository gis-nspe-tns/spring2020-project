            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Research has shown that economic inequality plays a role in levels of political participation in the U.S. elections (Solt 2008; Bartels 2002; Jacobs and Skocpol 2005). Though political engagement had been less economically stratified in the three decades after World War II due to widely available, federally administered social programs that both distributed economic benefits and encouraged civic engagement among the citizenry, subsequent decades of deindustrialization, market inequality, and a shrinking social safety net have increased and intensified economic inequality and thereby decreased electoral participation among the country’s least privileged citizens. Low-income and minority populations face several barriers to voting, such as voter ID laws, lack of polling locations in low-income communities, and lack of early voting options. These barriers are often difficult for these populations to overcome and get coupled with a sense that their votes do not matter because political leaders are more likely to be influenced by their most affluent constituents. With all of this in mind, and with the coming presidential election, I decided to use spatial analysis to assess the relationship between socioeconomic status and voter turnout. For the analysis summarized in this paper, I used American Community Survey and voting data from the U.S. Census Bureau to identify the relationship between poverty rate and voting rate at the congressional district level. I found that in districts with higher average poverty rates, the average voting rate is lower, and in districts with lower average poverty rates, the average voting rate is higher.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Starting September 1, 2020 the local law <B><i>Age limitations on school buses and replacing such school buses with all electric school buses</i></B> will obligate the city’s school bus contractors to replace buses without closed crankcase ventilation system with hybrid, natural gas, or all-electric vehicles; and by 2040 replace all school buses with electric vehicles. According to the new law, the priorities for bus replacement are given to buses with over 10 years in service. However, the disproportionate need for clean vehicles in different communities is not taken into account. This project demonstrates that in order to follow the law’s bottom line and alleviate air pollution burden on children with asthma, the law’s implementation team should consider cumulative effects of air pollution, asthma rates, and pollution sources locations and prioritize the bus replacement accordingly. The results of the project showed the disproportionate share of heavy air pollution in two UHF neighborhoods “High Bridge - Morrisania” (South Bronx) and “Central Harlem - Morningside Heights” (Northern Manhattan).</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Gender-based violence has long been associated with conflict, however the underlying causes are more nuanced than originally assumed. State fragility may also play a role in the prevalence and impunity of violence. Who is most at risk when there are overlapping vulnerabilities at play? Furthermore, if countries already do not perform well in protecting women’s well-being, this adds an additional layer. In my analysis, I looked at the risk of gender-based violence based across three variables: conflict, state fragility, and women’s wellbeing to determine which countries are most at risk.</p>

              <a class="text-dark">Evaluating Heat Risk and Mitigation Efforts in New York City</a>
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Heat-related health impacts exacerbated by rising temperatures are not equally felt. Employing a geospatial approach, this study investigates the distribution of heat risk in New York City at the district level as the product of mean temperature at the district level and selected social vulnerability factors. It further evaluates existing and planned green infrastructure mitigation efforts to assess whether higher risk areas are prioritized. Results show that 15 of the 59 districts across all five boroughs scored in the highest risk category, and that the number of mitigation projects per unit area in 10 of those 15 districts was below the citywide average, indicating that these districts may be under-prioritized in city planning efforts. Future studies should evaluate mitigation investment of cooling projects beyond green infrastructure and quantify them in terms of cost to gain a fuller perspective of how heat risk is being addressed in the City.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Asylum has been an important part of human rights law since the UN Refugee Convention was passed in 1951. Thousands of people have won asylum in the US, which has granted them a path to citizenship when, in their home countries, they were targeted and refused protection by their governments. However, with the Trump administration’s dismantling of the asylum process, especially on the southern border of the US, the demographics of asylum seekers have changed. While the total number of asylum seekers in 2018 has increased over previous years, more and more people from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have gained Withholding of Removal under the Convention Against Torture, which protects them from deportation to a dangerous situation back home while denying them the same rights and privileges as asylum seekers. </p>
