            <a class="text-dark">Poverty and Natural Disasters: Risk Analysis</a>
          </h5>
          <p class="card-text">On April 25, 2015, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the Katmandu area of Nepal. Less than 20 days later, on May 12, an aftershock of 7.3 magnitude happened. Between these two quakes, schools and health center buildings, water and power systems, roads, and houses were destroyed. More than 9,000 people died and 22,000 were injured. Although the location of natural disasters are global and don’t follow a defined distribution of income or GDP, the consequences once they do occur are nothing but unbiased. According to a UNDP report, women and children are 14 times more likely to die than men during a disaster, and minorities face the same challenges. One example of that is how the Dalits were neglected by relief efforts during the earthquake that hit Nepal in April/2015. “Disasters tend to hit the poorest and most marginalized demographics the hardest.<sup>[1]</sup>” Using GIS software and public data, this large-scale mapping was produced to show that socioeconomically vulnerable geographies have a higher risk of fatalities due those disasters.  The analysis utilized earthquakes that resulted in a death toll of at least 500 people between 1970-2015.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="card-text">In the last 20 years, the United States has seen a surge in the production of oil and natural gas primarily through unconventional wells. The term unconventional is used to describe shale plays with low permeability and which therefore need the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in order to release oil and gas reserves. It is this combination that we more commonly refer to today as fracking.  The practice is now taking place in approximately 15 states, with many others looking towards production or on the verge of spudding their first well. One such state that has been utilizing the technology thus far is Pennsylvania. Given its familiarity with extractive industries and strategic position atop one of the most prolific shale plays (Marcellus) in the country, Pennsylvania is in an unique position to once again contribute to a U.S. energy renaissance. However, many communities across the U.S. feel that they are being taken advantage of by the industry and are concerned about the influx of workers that an energy boom/bust cycle tends to bring. This work force mobility is the focus of this spatial analysis project. Using American Community Survey Census Data for Pennsylvania between 2013-2017, Pennsylvania counties were mapped to further investigate the composition of the state’s more heavily drilled counties.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This mapping project aims to propose a suitable plan for creating wildlife corridors for rare species in New York State. Suitable habitat data of 379 rare species was used and combined and with New York protected land data.  The intersecting points were found and mapped. This habitat data was used as these species are most at risk of extinction and the protected land map was used as these lands are already protected against development and should be the spaces that we bolster to protect wildlife diversity. Intersecting areas that were at least 10 square miles were then selected and mapped in 7 places. Maps of major roads, trails, and rugged terrain were then collected to find where the least cost path between these protected habitat areas. Unfortunately I was only able to figure out how to create a least-cost evaluation with ruggedness as a criteria. Corridors that also take into consideration distance from roads and buildings will be part of the next iteration. Suggestions were then made for two areas; 4 spots of protected habitats in the Adirondacks and two in the Hudson valley. Further research needs to be done to determine the best path for corridors based on residential and commercial areas. Finding the best width of these corridors based on the needs of the rare species will also be important to move this project along.

              <a class="text-dark">The Effect of Proximity to Express Bus Line Stops on Car Dependency and Commute Mode Choice in Los Angeles County</a>
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Los Angeles is one of the most car-dependent cities in the United States. Reliance on a motor vehicle in order to access jobs, as well as other economic and social opportunities, is a significant cost burden for low-income households. Conversely, a lack of access to a vehicle in areas that do not have reliable, robust public transportation networks can inhibit mobility and increase the incidence of economic and social isolation. This project seeks to examine the extent to which proximity to stops along Metro Rapid express bus lines reduces reliance on cars for commuting and allows for greater reliance on public transportation in Los Angeles County. In particular, it looks at these effects for the Orange Line ‘Bus Rapid Transit’ route. In order to perform the analysis, GIS data was obtained from the U.S. Census website and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority website. The GIS data was combined with tabulated census data to arrive at census tract-level demographic profiles and the final GIS analysis. The percentage of workers with no car access, and of the use of public transportation for commuting among workers who have car access, are lower along the Orange Line than along all Metro Rapid lines. However, car dependency is lower along Metro Rapid lines than for the larger area of analysis. Census tracts that are not in close proximity to Metro Rapid bus stops exhibit much higher rates of car dependency than those in close proximity.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Located off the Southernmost point of Italy, Sicily is the biggest island in Italy and the Mediterranean. The island is predominantly agriculture-focused, with three-quarters of the island's land-use designated for agriculture. Climate change and associated pressures have become increasingly noticeable around the globe. Sicily was chosen for its unique position on the Mediterranean coast. The study assesses precipitation, NDVI, and temperature anomalies to determine if the island is currently, and will likely experience in the future, increasingly anomalous changes due to climate change.
